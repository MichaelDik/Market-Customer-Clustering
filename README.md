# Market-Customer-Clustering

This project was created for the needs of a university course in Statistical & Machine Learning. We were given a csv with 440 customers and some features of them and we were 
asked to apply clustering techniques in order to find patterns (with or without using pre-existing categorization in our conclusions) and produce a report (the official report
is written in Greek, a translation in English with a third-party app was later added, so there might be some syntactical errors in the translated report). More details about
the project can be found in the reports.
